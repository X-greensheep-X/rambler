# rambler
Simulates a microphone jammer, specifically, the IProtect Rabbler.

# Slicing
Before you start rambling, you need to create "slices", 1 second audio clips that the rambler will use.
To slice, simply run the script with the -s arguement
<code>./rambler.py -s sound.wav</code>
This will create the slices and store them in a directory titled "slices"

# Rambling
To start rambling, run the script without arguements
<code>./rambler.py</code>
